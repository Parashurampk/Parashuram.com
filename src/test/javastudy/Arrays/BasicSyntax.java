		//extends is the keyword used to inherit the properties of a class.

		//finally keyword is used to define a finally block. The finally block follows a try block or a catch block.

		//Generally, the implements keyword is used with classes to inherit the properties of an interface.	
		//throw - If a method does not handle a checked exception, the method must declare it using the throws keyword.
		//Try - A method catches an exception using a combination of the try and catch keywords.

		  A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case, 
		  and the variable being switched on is checked for each case.
		  
		  for loop: A for loop is useful when you know how many times a task is to be repeated.
		  
		  for each loop is useful even when you do not know how many times a task is to be repeated.
		  
		  A while loop statement in Java programming language repeatedly executes a target statement 
		  as long as a given condition is true.
		  
		  A do...while loop is similar to a while loop, except that a do...while loop is guaranteed to execute at least one time.
		  
		  When the break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program control resumes 
		  at the next statement following the loop.
		  
		  In a for loop, the continue keyword causes control to immediately jump to the update statement.
		
		Class:-It should start with the uppercase letter.It should be a noun such as Color, Button, System, Thread, etcUse appropriate words, instead of acronyms
