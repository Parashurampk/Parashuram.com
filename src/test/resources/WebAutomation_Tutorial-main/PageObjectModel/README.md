# _Summary of Topics discussed_
- We started by discussing the Page Object Model (POM) and how it can help improve the maintainability and reusability of our automation code. We also talked about the implementation of POM, which involves creating a separate class for each web page or component and encapsulating the page-specific elements and methods in it.

- We then moved on to discuss the Page Factory, which is a utility class provided by Selenium to initialize web elements in a page object class. We talked about the benefits of using Page Factory to manage web elements and how it simplifies our automation code.

- Next, we explored how we can implement the Page Object Model in our automation code by creating page object classes and using Page Factory to initialize web elements in them. We discussed how this approach can help us write more efficient, maintainable, and scalable automation code.

Overall, we covered the key concepts related to the Page Object Model and how it can be implemented in our automation code.
